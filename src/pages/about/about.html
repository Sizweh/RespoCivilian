  Respo Technology is a start-up private company founded by Mr Nzuza on 21 June 2018. The objective of the company is to
  develop and market A Mobile App which will assist the ambulance industry in South Africa to shorten the emergency
  response time. When a call for an ambulance is made, Respo, identifies the exact location of the caller and
  simultaneously shares whatever information that is relevant with paramedics and other emergency health response staff.

  Respo is targeted at benefiting members of medical schemes and policy holders of medical insurance products. The
  customers of Respo will be ambulance companies, medical aid and medical insurance holders.
